A study into the psionic nature of humans on physical systems

According to BÃ¶sch's meta-analysis (Examining psychokinesis: The interaction of human intention with random number generators, 2018) and a study conducted by the CIA (EVIDENCE FOR CONSCIOUSNESS-RELATED ANOMALIES IN RANDOM PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, 1989), there is strong evidence to support the theory that humans possess some form of psionic connection to information systems.

I wanted to test the same effects on a quantum computer due to its esoteric nature. The following script simulates a quantum computer by means of IBM's Qiskit to generate a number between 0 and 100. It will ask you for that number 20 times but will not tell you if you are right or wrong. At the end of the 20 rounds, it will give you a score out of 20. The higher your score, the better. It will also tell you which guesses you got wrong.

## Study of Psionic Phenomena

Research suggests that certain areas of the brain might be involved in psionic phenomena. Studies in neuroscience have indicated that the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for decision-making and complex cognitive behavior, and the parietal lobe, which processes sensory information, could play significant roles in this phenomenon. Additionally, the temporal lobe, known for its role in perception and recognition, might also be involved in the ability to influence physical systems through intention.

## How to Use the Script

1. **Install Qiskit**:
    ```sh
    pip install qiskit
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```sh
    python psionics_simulation.py
    ```

3. **Follow the Prompts**: The script will ask you to guess a number between 0 and 100, 20 times. It won't tell you if you're correct after each guess.

4. **View Your Score**: After 20 rounds, the script will display your score and the correct numbers for the guesses you got wrong.

## Example Output

```sh
Round 1: Guess a number between 0 and 100: 42
Round 2: Guess a number between 0 and 100: 17
...
Your score: 15/20
Numbers you guessed incorrectly: [23, 47, 58, 91, 34]
